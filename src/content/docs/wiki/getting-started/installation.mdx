# Important update

I (Natesworks) will no longer be making any major updates to dotmenu.

**Why?**

There are many reasons so I'll just mention a few:

- Working on other projects


I am currently planning on making an opensource rogue-like game in Unity. More information coming soon ðŸ‘€.

- Demotivated


A big reason is also because I am simply demotivated. I just do not want to work on this project anymore and this is the reason I have not made any major contributions in ~1 month.

# .NET CLI
```
dotnet add package Dotmenu
```
# Package Manager Console in Visual Studio
```
NuGet\Install-Package Dotmenu -Version 1.0.0
```
# PackageRefrence
```
<PackageReference Include="Dotmenu" Version="1.0.0" />
```
# Paket
```
paket add Dotmenu --version 1.0.0
```
# Script & Interactive
```
#r "nuget: Dotmenu, 1.0.0"
```
# Cake
```
#addin nuget:?package=Dotmenu&version=1.0.0
```
```
#tool nuget:?package=Dotmenu&version=1.0.0
```
